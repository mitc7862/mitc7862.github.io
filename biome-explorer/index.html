                <p>The savanna biome is a tropical grassland with warm temperatures year-round and seasonal rainfall in the summer. 
                    It is characterized by grasses and dispersed trees that do not form a closed canopy, allowing sunlight to reach the ground. 
                    The African savanna contains a diverse community of organisms that interact to form a complex food web.</p>
